Arduino Uno(microcontroller):
--Microcontrollers are the boards that are used to control power supply.
--They have pins output and input.
--Pins are the pathways through which current flows and command flows.
--Types; Digital pins and Power pins.
----Digital pins..
           These are the pins through which commands are transferred. They provide current but a resistor is must used because, so the current may not over flow.
----Power pins..
           They are basically used to provide current. There are some output ranges present up there as 5V or 3V. 
           GND is also present there so they could return the current to battery and act as the battery path.
