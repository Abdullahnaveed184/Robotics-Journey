--In simple power is provided to input pin.
--Only in case, if sensor is closed, the current will go to Arduino.
--Arduino will read it as ON.
--If sensor opens, current will flow to the GND.
--Arduino will read it as OFF.
--This code is written in the Arduino:
void setup() {
  pinMode(7, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  if (digitalRead(7) == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  }
}

--So, if input is ON, the output will remain OFF.
--If input is OFF, output will be ON.

Why INPUT_PULL is used?
--As we know if there is no Arduino power pull the code will show a bug.
--To avid this bug and power mismanagement we use this.
--This allow a path for current to flow, in case GND is turned OFF.
