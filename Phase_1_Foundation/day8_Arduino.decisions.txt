Arduino brain(Decision making ability):-
--Arduino is one of the fastest microcontroller.
--As fast it performs, it also decides.
--Decisions are taken by the words "if" and "else".
--This important task is done by the code as:
__> if(digitaLRead(7)==LOW){
    digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
   }else{
    digitalWrite(13,LOW);
   }
    
--This is the fundamental of decision making in the machines.
--If we think then these are not decisions but simple codes.
  Interesting!
