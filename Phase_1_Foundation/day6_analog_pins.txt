Here is the third type of Arduino pin Pulse Width modulation(PWM):-
--These pins open the current for object but not constant.
--This is the way we provide some low power to object.
--These are the pins by which we control brightness of LEDs and speed of motors.
--These pins are shown by this,(~).
  e.g: pin= ~9.
--These are most useful pins in control.
